The goal for this The Odin Project is to create a sketchpad that runs in the browser.

The sketchpad can be colored with black, gray and rainbow colored trails left behind by the hovering of the mouse. A click of the mouse will stop the coloring from happening and can be reactivated with a second click.

There is an eraser button and a reset button. Both useful to redo specific trails or to restore the original canvas respectively. Finally, the canvas has the squared dimensions of the number inputed in the lower field. The number must be between 2 and 100.

This project required the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The use of Javascript was central in the creation of variable amounts of squares that could in turn be used as part of the canvas. Furthermore, the proper use of event listeners was essential to implement the hover effect and to change the color of the trail left by it.

The website was published via Github and can be accessed using the following link:
